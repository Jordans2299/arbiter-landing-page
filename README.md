# Arbiter Landing Page

A lightweight landing page for **Arbiter**, a fast, private, and customizable AI chat app that runs entirely on your device.

## About Arbiter

Arbiter uses local language models to deliver responsive conversations without sending data to the cloud. Choose different chatbot roles, adjust temperature for creative or precise replies, and keep chats organized with custom names. Everything is stored securely on your device.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – landing page markup
- `assets/css/styles.css` – site-wide styling
- `assets/images/` – logo and team headshots

## Development

No build tools are required. Open `index.html` directly in a browser or serve the directory with any static file server.

## Placeholders

Sections for screenshots, FAQ, contact info, and beta sign‑up include placeholder text. Replace these with real content, integrate a mailing list service for the beta form, and add app store/TestFlight links when available.
