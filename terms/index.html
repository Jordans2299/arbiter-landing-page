            <p>These Terms govern your use of Arbiter (“the App”). By using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>What Arbiter does</strong><br>
                    Arbiter is an iOS app that runs AI models locally on your device. You can select bundled models or
                    download additional models from third‑party sources.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Your responsibilities</strong><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lawful use.</strong> You’ll use Arbiter in compliance with applicable laws and the
                            licenses for any models you download.</li>
                        <li><strong>Model licenses &amp; content.</strong> Third‑party models and datasets may have
                            their own licenses and restrictions; you’re responsible for reviewing and complying with
                            them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Backups.</strong> Your chats and models are stored on your device. Maintain any
                            backups you need.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Third‑party links &amp; content</strong><br>
                    The App may link to third parties (e.g., Hugging Face). We don’t control or endorse third‑party
                    sites, content, or models and aren’t responsible for them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>No professional advice</strong><br>
                    Outputs from AI models may be incorrect or misleading and are provided “as is” for informational
                    purposes only. Arbiter does not provide professional advice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Acceptable use</strong><br>
                    Don’t use the App to violate laws, infringe rights, or produce/distribute harmful content. We may
                    restrict or terminate access for violations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ownership</strong><br>
                    We (or our licensors) own the App and its code. You retain rights to your own content. Third‑party
                    models are owned by their respective licensors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Disclaimers</strong><br>
                    THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
                    INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. We do not warrant
                    uninterrupted or error‑free operation or the accuracy of model outputs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Limitation of liability</strong><br>
                    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
                    CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, EVEN IF
                    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS RELATING TO THE APP SHALL NOT EXCEED
                    THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE APP (IF ANY) IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Indemnity</strong><br>
                    You will indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising from your misuse of the App, violation
                    of these Terms, or infringement of third‑party rights.

                    <strong>Changes</strong><br>
                    We may update these Terms. We’ll update the “Last updated” date and may provide in‑app notice for
                    material changes. Continued use means you accept the updated Terms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Governing law</strong><br>

                    preferred jurisdiction), excluding conflict‑of‑laws rules.
